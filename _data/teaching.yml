  abstract: "This master level course was covering wide range of topics in the subject of dynamical systems. We
taught student to treat physical and biological systems described by linear and nonlinear ODEs,
explained concept of chaos and it’s relation to fractals. The course was based on the book “Nonlinear
dynamics and Chaos” by S.Strogatz. Course consisted of 15 lectures and 15 tutorials (30 academic
hours each). Head teacher of the course was Prof. Antti Niemi while I was giving tutorial classes. In
my tutorial classes I was additionally actively using Wolfram Mathematica to illustrate some of the
dynamical system properties. I have also participated in designing and grading exams for the course."

  abstract: "This master level course was designed from scratch and taught by me. The course was focused on
gauge theories and in particular on their non-perturbative aspects. It consisted of 15 lectures (30
academic hours). For this course I wrote my own notes using “Aspects of Symmetry” by S.Coleman,
“Classical theory of gauge fields” by V.Rubakov and Preskill’s “Lecture notes on QFT“. There was no
exam and grades were based on several sets of homeworks. Also based on the material of the course
I proposed to students a number of small projects for extra points. One of the students, John Paton,
completed one of these projects ”On the large-N limit of gauge theories“."

CFT. The exam was in the form of the student presentations on the topics chosen from the list
proposed by me and Prof. Pasquetti."

The head teacher is Prof. Alba Grassi. The course takes more axiomatic approach to Quantum
Mechanics consisting of more formal approach with the heavier use of linear algebra and functional
analysis then the standard physics QM course and has less physics content. I taught part of the
problem solving sessions (15 hours out of total 24 hours) mostly on the finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces.
Part of the session time was devoted to the
review of more physical concepts of QM (black body radiation, photoeffect, paradoxes of QM etc.)
missing in the lectures. This reviews were prepared by me from the scratch in the form of lecture
material. Also my duty was to grade weekly homeworks for the course."

course was teaching so-called practical work sessions (42 hours). In Geneva University for these basic
courses math students are split into groups of 3-4. My goal was to give them problems to solve in front
of me, help and guide them through the solutions and control that students understand new material
in the course. During these classes I guided three such groups in separate times."
