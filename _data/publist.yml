  abstract: "We study straight vortices with global longitudinal currents in the Bogomol'ny limit of the Abelian Higgs model with two charged scalar fields. The model possesses global SU(2) and local electromagnetic U(1) symmetries spontaneously broken to global U(1) group, and corresponds to a semilocal limit of the standard electroweak model. We show that the contribution of the global SU(2) current to the vortex energy is proportional to the total current squared. Locally, these vortices carry also longitudinal electromagnetic currents, while the total electromagnetic current flowing through a transverse section of the vortex is always zero. The vortices with high winding numbers have, in general, a nested pipelike structure. The magnetic field of the vortex is concentrated at a certain distance from the geometric center of the vortex, thus resembling a ''pipe''. This magnetic pipe is layered between two electrically charged pipes that carry longitudinal electric currents in opposite directions."

  abstract: "We compute the QCD phase diagram in the plane of the chiral chemical potential and temperature using the linear sigma model coupled to quarks and to the Polyakov loop. The chiral chemical potential accounts for effects of imbalanced chirality due to QCD sphaleron transitions which may emerge in heavy-ion collisions. We found three effects caused by the chiral chemical potential: the imbalanced chirality (i) tightens the link between deconfinement and chiral phase transitions; (ii) lowers the common critical temperature; (iii) strengthens the order of the phase transition by converting the crossover into the strong first order phase transition passing via the second order end-point. Since the fermionic determinant with the chiral chemical potential has no sign problem, the chirally imbalanced QCD matter can be studied in numerical lattice simulations."

  abstract: "We study the relation between 5D super Yang–Mills theory and the holographic description of 6D $$(2, 0)$$ superconformal theory.
    We start by clarifying some issues related to the localization of SYM with matter on $$S^5$$. We concentrate on the case of a single
    adjoint hypermultiplet with a mass term and argue that the theory has a symmetry enlargement at mass $$M = 1/(2r)$$, where $$r$$ is the $$S^5$$ radius.
    However, in order to have a well-defined localization locus it is necessary to rotate $$M$$ onto the imaginary axis, breaking the enlarged symmetry.
    Based on our prescription, the imaginary mass values are physical and we show how the localized path integral is consistent with earlier results for
    5D SYM in flat space. We then compute the free energy and the expectation value for a circular Wilson loop in the large N limit. The Wilson loop
    calculation shows a mass dependent constant rescaling between weak and strong coupling. The Wilson loop continued back to to the enlarged symmetry
    point is consistent with a supergravity computation for an $$M2$$ brane using the standard identification of the compactification radius and the 5D
    coupling. If we continue back to the physical regime and use this value of the mass to determine the compactification radius, then we find agreement
    between the SYM free energy and the corresponding supergravity calculation. We also verify numerically some of our analytic approximations."

  abstract: "In this paper we investigate the large-$$N$$ behavior of 5-dimensional $$\\mathcal{N} = 1$$ super Yang-Mills with a level $$k$$ Chern-Simons
    term and an adjoint hypermultiplet. As in three-dimensional Chern-Simons theories, one must choose an integration contour to completely
    define the theory. Using localization, we reduce the path integral to a matrix model with a cubic action and compute its free energy in
    various scenarios. In the limit of infinite Yang-Mills coupling and for particular choices of the contours, we find that the free-energy
    scales as $$N^{5/2}$$ for $$U(N)$$ gauge groups with large values of the Chern-Simons ’t Hooft coupling, $$\\widetilde{\\lambda} ≡ N/k$$. If we also
    set the hypermultiplet mass to zero, then this limit is a superconformal fixed point and the $$N^{5/2}$$ behavior parallels other fixed
    points which have known supergravity duals. We also demonstrate that $$SU(N)$$ gauge groups cannot have this $$N^{5/2}$$ scaling for
    their free-energy. At finite Yang-Mills coupling we establish the existence of a third order phase transition where the theory crosses
    over from the Yang-Mills phase to the Chern-Simons phase. The phase transition exists for any value of $$\\widetilde{\\lambda}$$ , although the details
    differ between small and large values of $$\\widetilde{\\lambda}$$ . For pure Chern-Simons theories we present evidence for a chain of phase
    transitions as $$\\widetilde{\\lambda}$$ is increased."

  In particular, we are interested in two cases: theory with $$N_f$$ massive hypermultiplets in the fundamental representation and theory with one adjoint massive
  hypermultiplet. If these theories are considered on $$S^5$$ their partition functions can be localized to matrix integrals, which can be approximated by their
  values at saddle points in the large-$$N$$ limit. We solve saddle point equations corresponding to the decompactification limit of both theories. We find that
  in the case of the fundamental hypermultiplets theory experiences third-order phase transition when coupling is varied. We also show that in the case of one adjoint
  hypermultiplet theory experiences infinite chain of third-order phase transitions, while interpolating between weak and strong coupling regimes."

    three-fold. $$3d$$ spectral duality in this context descends from $$5d$$ spectral duality. Finally we discuss the $$2d$$ reduction

    constitutes a non-trivial precision test of holography in a non-conformal setting. The free energy of maximal SYM on $$S^6$$ diverges
    in the strong coupling limit which might signify the onset of little string theory. We show how this divergence can be regularized both
    in QFT and in supergravity. We also consider $$d=7$$ with a small negative ’t Hooft coupling and show that the free energy and Wilson

    we show that its width equals $$1$$ in units of the inverse sphere radius, which allows us to find the leading correction to the free energy
    when turning on the Yang-Mills term. We then consider $$USp(2N)$$ theories with an antisymmetric hypermultiplet and $$N_f$$ fundamental hypermultiplets

    of the van Diejen model. The three different generalizations are directly related to three different effective gauge theory descriptions
    one can obtain by compactifying the minimal $$(D_{N+3},D_{N+3})$$ conformal matter theories on a circle to five dimensions.
