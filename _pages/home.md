### Welcome!

I am a Research Associate (PostDoc) at the <a href="https://www.kcl.ac.uk/research/theoretical-physics">Theoretical Physics Division</a> 
of King's College London. My research interests lie on the ntersetcion of physics and mathematics. In partcular I am interested in 
studying various aspects of supersymetric gauge theories and mathematical strcutures which often happen to emerge in  these 
theories. At the moment I am especially interested in elliptic integrable systems that arise in the computations of superconformal indices 
of gauge theories with insertion of surface defects. You can read more about my research <a href="/research/" target="_blank">here</a>.
